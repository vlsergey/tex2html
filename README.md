This tool is an almost pure Java implementation for Tex-to-HTML translation. Primary goal is to provide FB2 and MOBI formats for https://github.com/vlsergey/infosec project (book about information security). But other TeX/LaTeX projects can make use of it as well.

Planned features:
* minimum dependencies except JDK and may be NodeJS (for mathjax formula pictures generation)
* GitHub action for simple usage
